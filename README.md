# DCF-Calculator
A small program to predict the future value of a company based on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model

Variables:

FV: This is the future value of the company that you are trying to predict.

CF: Cash Flow. This is the annual free cash flow of the company. Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash produced by the company that is left over after accounting for capital expenditures. It's calculated as EBIT(1-Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization - Change in Net Working Capital - Capital Expenditure.

g: This is the expected annual growth rate of the free cash flow. The growth rate might be based on the company's historical growth rates or based on the industry average growth rate.

n: Number of periods. In this case, n = 5 (for 5 years).

r: Discount rate. This is the rate of return required by an investor from the company. The discount rate can be calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In CAPM, the discount rate equals the risk-free rate plus the company's equity Beta times the equity market risk premium. The risk-free rate is typically based on the yield on a long-term government bond.
